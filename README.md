# Neptunium public archive
This is a partial archive of an unfinished Minecraft cheat modification's source code I wrote mostly back in 2020.
Only things provided are most of the Java source code to the modification itself, not even containing hooks to the game code. 
There may be mature or slightly offensive language in the comments, the code is old and I never planned to release it.

No Git history is provided.

## About the software / modification
This software doesn't have much of interest to the general public, nor those who just want to cheat in the game and ruin the fun for others.
The project was essentially abandoned very early on to development due to lack of motivation to continue working on Minecraft modifications, 
as such, there are no features useful to any end user.

The "base" of the modification is the interesting part here, and is the reason I ended up releasing this code. There is some rather neat code, 
and I'm confident to say that this is one of the cleaner yet flexible codebases out of all the internal Minecraft cheats made in the era.
Keep in mind however, that even this code is not perfect; There are some poor design choices and things that could be done differently, 
but as an excuse this was for the most part written years ago.

There is no code taken from other projects, unlike most Minecraft cheat modifications written in the time.

## More information to those familiar with this stuff
The base is really neat compared to most of the stuff I've seen, but it's old already.
The cheat was written with MCP 918 (iirc) patched to 1.8.9, back when MCP was the norm and 1.8 was still relevant.
I haven't included MCP code nor any libraries in the repository, so not even game hooks are to be found.

There's no cool modules or anything like that, but the base is unlike anything from back when this was made, containing some cool things 
such as a proper (totally unfinished) UI "engine"/framework and an over-engineered settings system.

For those who know me from the community, this is only the scrapped recode of Neptunium, 
the even older version or my previous clients are not included.
At one point I was planning for this to be the base of the planned Rise recode (6.0), but Tecnio had already started
work on a new base when most of this code was ready.

Im not involved in the Minecraft cheat nor anticheat development communities in any way nowadays.
